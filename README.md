# SmartClassroom Comfort Level Prediction

This project analyzes real-time environmental data from smart classrooms to assess and predict comfort levels. It combines a hardware IoT setup (built with ESP32 and sensors) with a machine learning model in R that classifies the comfort level into four categories based on temperature, humidity, and air quality (CO₂).

---

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time environmental monitoring using ESP32 and sensors
- Uploads sensor readings to ThingSpeak for remote visualization
- Cleans and preprocesses data using R
- Predicts classroom comfort levels using a Random Forest model
- Visualizes and evaluates model accuracy

---

## 🔧 Hardware Setup

### 📟 Components Used

- **ESP32 DevKit v1** – WiFi-enabled microcontroller
- **DHT11/DHT22 Sensor** – Measures temperature and humidity
- **MQ135 Gas Sensor** – Measures air quality (CO₂ equivalent)
- **OLED Display (0.96")** – Displays live readings
- **ThingSpeak** – Cloud platform for data monitoring

### 🌐 Data Upload

Sensor readings are sent via WiFi from the ESP32 to ThingSpeak at regular intervals.

### 🖥️ Sample OLED Output

Temp: 25°C
Humidity: 55%
CO2: 620 ppm
Status: Moderate

## 🧠 Comfort Level Classification

| Comfort Score | Level           |
|---------------|------------------|
| 0             | Good (1)         |
| 1–5           | Moderate (2)     |
| 6–10          | Poor (3)         |
| >10           | Uncomfortable (4)|

Based on deviation from ideal ranges:
- Temperature: 22–26°C
- Humidity: 40–60%
- CO₂: 400–700 ppm

## 🛠️ Software (ML Model in R)

### Tech Stack

- **Language:** R
- **Libraries:** `randomForest`, `caret`
- **Model:** Random Forest

### Pipeline

1. Load and clean sensor data
2. Impute missing values using mean
3. Calculate comfort level based on predefined thresholds
4. Train Random Forest classifier on historical data
5. Evaluate on 30% test data
6. Predict for new unseen values

## 🧪 How to Run (R Model)

```r
install.packages("randomForest")
install.packages("caret")
source("comfort_model.R")

Update new test input:

new_data <- data.frame(temperature = 24, humidity = 50, co2 = 600)
predict(rf_model, new_data)
